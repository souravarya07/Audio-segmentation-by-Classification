Audio segmentation by classification:

Using the features of audio signals we've did the classification. The results of the classification are further used to do the segmentation in the audio files, which are mix of 
different audio classes. 
We've used the GTZAN dataset, which include 10 audio classes, each class with 100 audio files in wav format.
Dataset for the this project can be downloaded from the kaggle:
